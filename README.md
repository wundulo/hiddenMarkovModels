hiddenMarkovModels
==================

Hidden Markov Models using forward algorithm to score a given nucleotide sequence, using transition matrix, emissions matrix and initial probabilities.

Usage: $ python hiddenMarkovModels.py {sequence composed of a,c,t,g}

For test condition to ensure algorithm is accurate, use the test condition variables (transmission matrix and emission matrix) and comment out the given matrices.
